            Appearing on 'The Project' Austrialia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, revealed that he invested substantial amounts of money in a new automated trading platform. The idea was simple: allow the average person the opportunity to cash in on the digital currency boom. Even if they have absolutely no investing or technology experience.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">

            A user would simply make an initial deposit into the platform, usually of $250 or more, and the automated trading algorithm would go to work. Using a combination of data and machine learning, the algorithm would know the perfect time to buy and sell digital assets, maximizing the user's profit. Anthony Albanese told us that he used his credit card for the initial deposit!

This new trading platform was launched in United States back in January 2023 but as of few days ago it opened up it's doors to <strong>
  Australian
</strong> citizens as well.

To demonstrate the power of the platform Anthony Albanese had Sarah Harris deposit $250 live on the show.

          <div class="banner-2 border-left d-flex   my-4">
            <blockquote class="mx-2 fs-5">“I've heard about digital currencies and the massive amount of money you can make from it, but I've never bought any. I had no idea where to start. This was really easy, I can just use my credit card to deposit money, and it buys them for me.” said Anthony</blockquote>
          </div>
          <p class="fs-5">
            After her initial deposit for $250 was made, the trading platform went to work buying low and selling high. Within 3 minutes, he had successfully increased his initial funds to $483.18. That's a $258.18 profit.
          </p>
          <img class="w-100" src="./image/3rdimage.png" alt="">
          <span class="fst-italic">Sarah deposited $250 and tried the system for herself. Within minutes on , she was up over $539.13 in profit!</span>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Everyone on the show including the production staff were immediately impressed by how easy it was to make money. The platform handles all the trading work automatically, and because the price of digital currencies is quite volatile, there are numerous opportunities to profit.

          <p class="fs-5 my-2">
            Before Anthony even had a chance to respond to everyone's questions, Sarah interrupted and said with a smile on her face: "I've gone up to $398.42 in profits after just 8 minutes".
          </p>
          <div class="banner-2 border-left d-flex   my-4">
            <blockquote class="mx-2 fs-5">“Digital currencies are so hot right now, and even if someone like me, who has no knowledge, can make money from it, I'm all in. I need to have a piece of this!” said Anthony</blockquote>
          </div>
          <p class="h1 fw-bold">Does it actually work?</p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            We decided to put to the test, to see if it was really possible for you to make money using the platform.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            We quickly discovered that the platform charges a commission of 2% on profits a user generates and you need to make a minimum deposit of $250 to get started. That money will be your initial investment, which the trading software uses to trade.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            Also, we learnt that makes money by buying when the price goes up <strong>AND</strong> when the price goes down. This is known as short-selling and the platform automatically handles it for you.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            I decided to sign up for an account with , but <strong>their allocation was exhausted</strong>. I reached out and asked if we could receive 10 invitations for our readers in return for reviewing their platform - they agreed.
          </p>
          <p class="h1 fw-bold">My results with after 7 days</p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            On the show, Sarah was able to make $258.18 in profit after 3 minutes, for me, it took much longer. The platform took 20 hours to generate a <strong>$80.19</strong> profit, which still impressed me a lot! I've never purchased Bitcoin before and never made a trade in my life, yet here I was able to generate profits.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            I spent about 5 minutes a day checking my results and after <strong>5 days</strong> , the platform had traded up to a massive total of <strong> $630</strong>. That is a <strong>252% increase </strong> in my initial deposit. I was starting to become a true believer in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            After <strong>7 days </strong> my initial investment had traded up to <strong>$1,930</strong>. At this point, my mind was blown with how much easier life will be with this extra income stream. This is more money than I make as a journalist and I spend less than 30 minutes checking the platform.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            I decided to keep my account active for  <strong>15 days</strong> in total, because I wanted to see how high it could go. My account eventually hit a peak of <strong>$7,480.10</strong> but had three negative trades, the highest loss being -$79.51. I looked through my trading logs and discovered that not every trade is profitable, some actually lose money.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            The platform isn't magic, but after <strong>93% of my trades were profitable</strong>, the end result was that I made <strong>$7,300.59</strong> from my initial deposit of $250. It took me less than 30 minutes of work a week and absolutely no technical or investing experience.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            As you can see from the screenshot below, I decided to withdraw <strong>$7,300.59</strong> from my account to make sure they actually pay you.. which they did.
          </p>

          <span class="fst-italic">How I easily withdrew my money from my account</span>
          <p class="fs-5 my-3">
            All in all, I have made $7,300.59 so far from using . I made another deposit of $5,000 today and I will update this post next week with my latest results.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 my-5"> <strong>Note:</strong> It took 48 hours for the money to be withdrawn in to my personal bank account.</p>
